# pnad_covid19_brworkers
### This repository refers to the analysis of the profile of Brazilian workers in delivery and ride-hailing platforms 
The script, inspired by previous efforts, allows you to access data from the PNAD Covid-19 - details of which can be read here: << https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/statistics/social/labor/27975-weekly-release-pnadcovid1.html >>.

It details gender, education, income, and working hours for two platform workers: delivery workers and drivers.

In addition, it compares these platform workers with formal workers in order to check for differences between workers performing the same labour activities.
